# mp3-to-mp4
An ffmpeg script for creating an MP4 video using a given MP3 as the audio and a given image as the video.
This script assumes that you have ffmpeg ready to go. I use this in the Windows Command Prompt, it may have to be modified to work on other platforms.
Replace words in [brackets] with the appopriate file name.
