# mp3-to-mp4
An ffmpeg script for creating an MP4 video using a given MP3 as the audio and a given image as the video.
This script assumes that you have ffmpeg ready to go. I use this in the Windows Command Prompt, it may have to be modified to work on other platforms.
Replace words in [brackets] with the appopriate file name.
convert.bat will convert a single file.
batch-convert.bat will take all MP3 files in a folder, and one image file, and create an MP4 for each MP3.
